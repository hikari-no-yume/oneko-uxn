This is a port of [oneko-sakura](http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/) to [uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) using [chibicc-uxn](https://github.com/lynn/chibicc).

oneko-sakura is one of the the many versions of “Neko”. Lineage: oneko-sakura by Kiichiroh Mukose et al (see [README](http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/distfiles/README)) ← oneko by Tatsuya Kato et al (see [history website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010502181733/http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA004959/oneko/nekohist.html)) ← xneko by Masayuki Koba. The original Neko is Neko.COM by naoshi, see [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2)).

This port is based on version `oneko-1.2.sakura.5` from <http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/distfiles/oneko-1.2.sakura.5.tar.gz>. An unmodified copy is included at `original/oneko-1.2.sakura.5.tar.gz`. The rest of the files in this repo are the port. Note that the `README`, `README-NEW`, `README-SUPP`, `oneko.man` and `oneko.man.jp` files are unmodified from the original except for character set conversion.
